# Interfaces Example

## Concept
Through the course of a small example of different shapes, the concept of interfaces should be made clear.  
The program consists of a managable size and is prone to simplicity.

## Setup
### Interfaces and Classes
#### IShape
	 Defines an Interface for different classes, such as
	 * Square 

### Properties
Abstract Declaration for X and the Y values.

### Methods
A Draw() function to Draw the shape on the screen.

## Process
{describes the build process of the program (the approach, etc.)}

## Result and Output
{Showcase the expected result for the program}

## Room for optimization
{What can be optimized?}
